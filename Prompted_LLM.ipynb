            "**Pros of Aspirin:**\n",
            "1. **Pain Relief:** Aspirin is effective in reducing pain from various conditions such as headaches, muscle aches, and toothaches.\n",
            "2. **Anti-inflammatory:** It helps reduce inflammation, making it beneficial for treating conditions like rheumatoid arthritis.\n",
            "3. **Antipyretic Effects:** Aspirin is useful in lowering fever.\n",
            "4. **Prevention of Blood Clots:** It inhibits platelet aggregation, thereby reducing the risk of blood clots. This is particularly beneficial in preventing strokes and heart attacks in appropriate populations.\n",
            "5. **Cardiovascular Benefits:** Regular use of low-dose aspirin can prevent the recurrence of heart attacks and strokes in individuals with a history of these conditions.\n",
            "6. **Possible Cancer Prevention:** Some studies suggest that long-term use of aspirin may reduce the risk of certain types of cancer, including colorectal cancer.\n",

            "**Cons of Aspirin:**\n",
            "1. **Gastrointestinal Problems:** Aspirin can cause stomach upset, ulcers, and even gastrointestinal bleeding, especially when used frequently or in high doses.\n",
